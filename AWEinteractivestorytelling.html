	<h1> HOMELESS VETERAN PROTEST </h1>

				Ramin told us this story of a veteran of the Transnistrian war on the Moldovan side. The man suffered an injury but remained until the end of the conflict. After returning home, his injury persisted to cause problems until the point he had to seek treatment. Upon his arrival back to Causeni, he was confronted with a house left in ruins, demolished by the government. After several attempts to talk to the local authorities he came to the central square in Chisinau, Moldova, and built a hut from scraps and started his protest asking for house. He is now seven years into his protest.
